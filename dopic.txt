DOPIC

Converts Lotus 123 PIC files from the Psion Spreadsheet into PostScript files. Maybe.

DOPIC.OPL and DOPIC.OPO

Source and executable for running on the Psion. This comes up with a dialog box prompting for two
filenames when you run it. The first filename is the name of the PIC file you have just created in
Spreadsheet. It will appear in the \SPR\ directory with a file extension of PIC by default, so
those are the defaults expected by DOPIC.

The second filename is the name of the PostScript file to be produced. This will appear in the
\OPD\ directory by default, although you can of course press TAB to pull up the full file selector.
You will be prompted for confirmation if you try to overwrite an existing file.

DOPIC.C and DOPIC.EXE

It was compiled under MS Visual C++ 1.52 for MS-DOS, though it compiles just as easily for QuickWin.
It is written in ANSI C, not C++.

This source has also compiled successfully with GNU GCC under VMS. That executable is not included
here.

MS-DOS Usage:

DOPIC PICfilename [PSfilename]

Leaving out PSfilename will result in the output file being called the same as the input file, but
with the file extension .PS instead of .PIC.

Usage for other machines:

DOPIC PICfilename PSfilename
