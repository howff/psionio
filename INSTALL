If you have downloaded the programs then all you need to do is to run them.
For example in Windows start an MS-DOS prompt, change to this directory and
run the required program.  DOS can redirect output in the same way as Unix
so the examples in the manual should all work fine.

If you want to rebuild the programs from the source code then follow the
instructions below.

To compile just type 'make'.

First make the following changes to suit your system:

1) Makefile
 a) CC      change the command used to invoke the compiler (eg. CC=gcc)
 b) CFLAGS  change the compilation flags (eg. CFLAGS=-O or CFLAGS=-g)
 c) CFLAGS  change the architecture (eg. SUN, PC, ACORN or the explicit
            byte ordering    [ ** IMPORTANT ** ]
 d) CFLAGS  add -DCONVERTCHARS if you need characters converted between
            ISO-8559-1 (standard) and IBM-CodePage-850 (Psion) [Note that
            not all characters can be converted properly both ways].
 e) LIBS    change the libraries needed

2) psionio.h
 a) getopt  you may need to alter the getopt definitions; if your compiler
            does not provide getopt functions then you can obtain them
            from GNU repositories or by e-mail from myself.
 b) strdup  you may need to change the definition.

Note:
getopt.c is supplied here but is not part of the psionio suite of programs.
It is simply supplied for your convenience.
